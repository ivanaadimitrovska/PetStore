Overview of the Code Functionality:

Create Users Endpoint: This endpoint, mapped to "/create-users", triggers the "createUsers" service method. The method generates 10 random users and assigns necessary attributes to each, including a unique email address for each user. Create Pets Endpoint: Mapped to "/create-pets", this endpoint invokes the "createPets" service method. The method generates 20 random pets, assigning each a type (dog or cat) randomly, and sets the price based on the pet's age. List Users Endpoint: Mapped to "/list-users", this endpoint calls the 
"listUsers" service method, which retrieves a list of all users in the database. Additionally, it invokes the "listPets" method, returning a list of all pets in the database. Buy Pets Endpoint: Mapped to "/buy/all", this endpoint calls the "buyPets" function from the service. The process involves iterating through users in the database. For each user, it checks if there's an unowned pet in the database. If so, it attempts to purchase the pet for the user. If the user has sufficient budget, the pet's ownership is transferred to the user, and the user's budget is adjusted accordingly. A message is then logged based on whether the pet is a cat or a dog. If the user lacks the budget, an appropriate message is printed. Counters for successful and unsuccessful purchases are updated accordingly. Within this process, the "BuyResponse" object is utilized for testing purposes. Additionally, a new object of the "BuyHistory" entity is created within the "buyPets" method to log the transaction time and update the counters for successful and unsuccessful purchases. History Log Endpoint: Mapped to "/historyLog", this endpoint exclusively returns a log list with three specified columns as per the specification.
